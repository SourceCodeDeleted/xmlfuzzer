Description :
-------------

Xmlfuzzer takes XML Scheme on input and returns valid XML document with random data.

Building :
----------

First you need to get:
* an OCamlduce compiler >= 3.11 (http://www.cduce.org/ocaml);
* GNU Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/);
* xml-light (http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight.html);
* extlib for OCaml (http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/).

Then simply run

> make

Getting pre-builded binaries :
------------------------------

Compiling OCamlduce application is not too funny, so you can just download pre-compiled binaries.

Runtime dependencies :
----------------------

Optionally you need these runtime dependecies:
* tidy — just for pretty-printing (http://tidy.sourceforge.net/);
* GNU parallel — a tool for executing jobs in parallel (http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/).

Usage :
------
